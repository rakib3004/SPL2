# Bidders-Den-System
Introduction
Bidder’s Den will be an online auction place, where people will be able to sell and buy goods online through bidding, sitting from home.

The company will have a dedicated warehouse to store the products. Sellers will send their product details (including photos, purchasing price, purchasing memo, time used, current state, base price etc) to the company. The company will then verify the details and accept/reject the product for auction. If accepted, the seller has to send the product to the company. The company will receive the product, store it in the warehouse and it will be on the website on next auction day. The bidders will then bid for their desired product until the time ends. After the time ends, the product will be handed over to the buyer with courier or other ways they are convenient with.

This project aims to develop a complete web application that will help sellers to sell, buyers to bid and buy through the company.

## Motivation:

Auctions work for buyers and sellers alike because everyone involved wins. 

In early 2020, many auctioneers were obliged to transition to online auctions because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But, it was perhaps the catalyst in a necessary shift to best serve all buyers and sellers. 

In Bangladesh, currently there’s not a single dedicated popular online auction site.

What we intend to do is to create a lively web application that will-

Be easy to use 
Show live actions and results  
Eliminate long negotiation periods, save the hassle of negotiating
Deadlines will motivate the market to make real offers to buy real quick
A structured sale reduces risk and maximizes value
Buyers are treated fairly and on the same terms as others competing for the same product
In an auction the buyers know that they are only competing against other buyers and that the seller is not bidding, that fuels the mentality
Instant engagement from marketing (Bidders can go from an email to bidding in 5 seconds, so they won’t forget about the auction)
More buyers, larger reach
No moving and onsite activity, save time and money

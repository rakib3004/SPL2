In the 14th century a muslim historian named Ibn Khaldunwrote about the ancient empires and how the firstcivilizations emerged along Major Rivers.The Huang Ho Valley in China,Indus River in Pakistanand more famously the Nile River in Egypt.The Historian wrote how these rivers  allowed easy accessto trade and commerce and from there grew into majorcities and then to civilizations.But more interestingly,Ibn Khaldun wrote about the Pattern of history;Farmers would build irrigation system supporting villages and towns,later on some warrior would bring these towns under his ruleand form a united political entity,like a kingdom or an empire.Then a tribe of Nomads would come alongand conquer this kingdomand seize all the holdings and settle in their placeand further expand the new empire.As time went by the nomads would assimilate and become soft city dwellersexactly the kind of people they had conquered beforeand at this point another tribe of Nomads would come alongand conquer them and take their empire.Conquest,consolidation,expansion,degenerationand conquest.This was the Pattern Ibn Khaldun wrote about.The first civilization was the land between the rivers of Tigris and Euphrates,later known as Mesopotamia and Babylon.Less known are the Sumerians who started it all.They united the cities near the river of Euphrates into a single network called Sumer.They invented writing,the wheel,the cart, etc.Later, the Akkadians,a mountainous people to the north,conquered Sumerand their leader Sargon (of) Akkad became the first conqueror known by name.At the time this was the largest kingdomand Sargon famously said,"Now, any king who wants to call himself my equal, wherever I went, let him go"He basically said, let's see anyone conquer as much as I have.His kingdom was smaller than Serbia.Later the Acadians were conquered by another nomadic tribeand the newcomers were then conquered by othersand so it went on...the Gutians,Hurrians,Amorites,they all conquered, settled, expanded a littleand then assimilatedfrom warrior to city folk.But every conquest left something behindThe Amorites founded the city of Babylonand from the City emerged the first Babylonian Empire.The Babylonians were pioneers inastronomy and mathematics.Then the Assyrian tribe to the North took it over and founded the Assyrian Empire.Their capital Nineveh is considered one of the greatest cities in antiquity.The assyrians made a number of innovations and improvementsThey erected the first library and used paved roads.They even came up with the first kind of imperial administrationin which subject nations and vassals reported to a central authority.But the Assyrian Rulers also gained a reputation as merciless tyrants.Now, it's hard to say if they were really worse than the other rulers in their time,but one of their strategies to keep the realm stable was by moving whole populations to other places.After a while the Assyrians lost their power to other tribes like the Sumerian descendants,Babylonians,Kassitites.These tribes fought each other for about two centuriesuntil the Assyrians came backand re-established their empire and returned to their divide and rule strategy.Eventually the Assyrians fell to one of their subject nations, The Chaldeans.They rebuilt the second Babylonian Empire,and they're well known for their achievements in astronomy, medicine,architecture and mathematics.In fact it was the Chaldeans who built the hanging gardens of Babylonone of the ancient seven world wonders.But the Chaldeans followed the same strategy as the Assyrians hadby uprooting whole populations in order to divide and rule.It was the Chaldean King of Babylonia, Nebuchadnezzarwho first smashed Jerusalem and dragged the Hebrews into captivity.Then came the invasion by the highland people to the east,the Persians and the Medes.The Babylonians were defeated and their infrastructure and political system was used to found the Persian Empire.The Persian emperor Cyrus the Great Had conquered the known world.His realm extended from the Nile to the Indus river.But the Persians are best known for their political reforms.They followed the opposite strategy of the Assyrians.They set the Hebrews free from captivity and resettled populations to their native lands.The Persians pursued a policy of multiculturalism.People were allowed to live however they saw fitand worship whatever gods they wanted,as long as they paid their taxes to the central authority.They issued a common currency and built a vast network of roads throughout the empire.The Persian libraries were so largethat there is in fact more information about this period, 3,000 years agothan there is in Europe 1200 years ago.The Persian Empire also had its own unique religion.Zoroastrianism was founded in the region of Azerbaijan, meaning the land of fire.Zoroastrianism is often misunderstood for fire worshipingBut the fire is a mere symbol for purity.The Zoroastrians basically believed in good and evil.That there was a heaven, and there was a hell.It was one of the earliest monotheistic religions.In the later era of the Persian Empire,They came in contact with the Greeks.The Greeks Supported revolts in the Persian Empireand this provoked the Persian emperor, Darius to punish the Greeks.Darius formed one of the largest armies everbut the size was more a liability than an advantage.There was no real effective way to direct so many men at such a distance.In the end it was the greeks who taught the Persians a lesson.But the lesson was quickly forgotten.Darius' son Xerxes decided to Avenge his father by going after the greeks again.This is the war that involved the famous 300 Spartans.Darius repeated his father's mistake and lost the war.150 years later Alexander of Macedonia took the Battle the other way.He crippled the Persian army and quickly conquered all of Persiaand thereby effectively conquered the known world.Alexander left a controversial mark,cities that had surrendered to him were left unharmed,but cities that resisted were pillaged.When he had conquered the Persian capital and the palace he burned it to the ground.Now this was one of the most prestigious buildings in the world.But on the other hand he built the lighthouse of Alexandria,one of the ancient seven world wonders.Alexander was planning to name Babylon his new capitaland he also planned to fuse the greek and Persian cultures into one.He recommended his generals to take Persian wivesbut he died before he could implement this policy.And upon his death, his generals asked him,"Who should succeed you

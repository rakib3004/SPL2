hey guys what's up it's Karl here back with another episode and continuing on the Apple train this week as they release three new products we first had the MacBook Air which I just dropped my very first video the other day so I'll leave it linked up in this way they also have the iPad pro which I'm also working on a video stay tuned till next week and of course the more low-key one which was there Mac Mini this one wasn't as hyped we only have a few little upgrades so here's my unboxing and review of Apple's small and mini desktop so you can see here Mac Mini on the box it's remained the same as last year and like I said it's even the same form factor we've just got the standard box as it is the Mac Mini nothing else is included it's just the computer you need to grab your own keyboard and mouse this guy actually slides out this way so you can see the Mac Mini up top and we will do some more ASMR magic so here is the Mac Mini in a nice space gray finish you can see that the Apple logo is in the darker almost black chrome we've got the power output Ethernet for USB C ports HDMI to USB a ports and the good old headphone jack and other than that we've got a very smooth piece an expensive piece of aluminum the rest of the box designed by California in Apple very standard stuff we've got our good old user manuals and unfortunately just standard white stickers we can get by and we just have the good old power cable and that is essentially the unboxing and the machining on Apple products is second to none it looks great it feels great it feels like a solid block of aluminum but like I said if we bring last year's model up these are virtually the exact same device there is no difference from what I can tell aesthetically and if I mix these up I probably wouldn't tell you which is which unless I plug them in we'll take my space great sticker from my macbook air foam so this is the old one I know because it has the sticker this is the new Mac Mini so who is this device actually for and what's changed this year we now have double the storage in each of the models I know it isn't anything too crazy so the base end which retails for 800 bucks you now get 256 gigs of storage the $1100 one that will start off at 512 they're also now made out of a hundred percent recycled aluminum just like a lot of their products so that's always good but essentially that is the Mac Mini so I am technically able to review this guy as my last gen model that already had 256 gigs and it's now the same device so the Mac Mini is for someone that knows they're going to be sitting at a dedicated desk as it is technically a desktop the portability of this even though you could stick this in a backpack it doesn't have that same form factor as a laptop you can't use it on a battery when you compare this to say the MacBook Air 800 dollars versus a thousand we have a fully mobile device so you can use this essentially anywhere yes the Mac Mini does have better specs but it also has the older chipsets it's got the 8th gen Intel Core processors whereas the new MacBook Air has the 10th gen and I don't really think upping the storage to 256 makes a big difference anyways because most people with dedicated desktops will end up having an external hard drive stick one into the USBC port and you can get double triple quadruple the storage for half or a third of the price of what Apple is offering with that being said I still think there's a bit of value for Mac minis you do need extra peripherals and I don't think everyone needs a dedicated say iMac to run in their setup you do need to have a mouse keyboard and monitor I'll go through some of my recommendations for keyboard choices I've kind of pulled - if you are in the Apple ecosystem you may already have an iMac iMac Pro so this keyboard works totally fine I am still a number pad fan when I'm doing my finances I think that there have been easier to work with and my second recommendation is the Logitech MX master keys I don't think it looks as good as the iMac keyboards but it does feel way better on the hands that the experience is easier but I do think it's a happy medium between design and ergonomics it's still got some of the space great it fits in well and I think would match perfectly with your Mac Mini mess recommendations there's only one that I can really promote it's the Logitech MX master 3 the next thing which you'll need is a monitor and this is a 4k LG to the 32 UL 950 USB C enabled so it should run off of one cable let's get this guy plugged in and within a couple clicks later we've got the Mac Mini setup so we're just running a very simple setup we've got all the peripherals connected by bluetooth we've got the one USBC cable and we're rocking a 4k image on a 32 inch monitor so everything looks really good but like I said for the Mac Mini you really need to consider are you solely sticking in a non mobile setup will you always be at your desk I would personally grab the macbook air and if you already have a previous gen Mac Mini like my good old stickered version you don't need to upgrade to the 2020 model having that extra storage space isn't a reason in its own to upgrade and everything that you can do on the Mac Mini you can also do on the MacBook Air so unless you have a baller monitor setup you can also plug in your macbook air into that I'm kind of trying to draw reasons why you should grab this device and I guess you could run multiple to have extra processing power but I think that's just becoming a bit overkill but I do think there is still a niche market for the Mac Mini and that's why we continue to see it being updated let me know your thoughts down below in the comments hopefully you guys enjoyed this review stay posted for my new iPad pro video dropping in the next couple days so make sure you sub to the channel and I will catch the rest of you in hopefully that next episode peace and stay safe

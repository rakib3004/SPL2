where are they and when are they well
where are they is that they live on the
step and that's the dark green bit uh on
the map
you can see this great swathe of a sort
of carpet
uh going from
manchuria in the east
right across central europe and ending
up in in the great hungarian plain up
there great hungarian plane is the last
bit of step
so um
that area um open rolling grassland is
the homeland of of these people they
were as
as you've seen from the title they were
nomads
and they responded uh they were
conditioned their lifestyle was
conditioned by this grassland now there
is one
um very important thing uh to know about
this
and that is that
the step is not an a sort of even
environment the step up here in mongolia
which is if you want to see step that's
the place to go
is
cold and very dry
but as you get further and further and
further west
it gets
more moderate in temperature
and certainly wetter
and that means that the grass is lusher
so uh if you were
step nomads in that area there would be
a tendency always to want to move
further west where the grass literally
is greener
all the way and that sets up what's
called the step gradient
which encourages people
to move and to move and to move and the
whole history of this
of the scythians and the scythian
related peoples uh is of of this
movement always from the east to the
west always ending up in the great
hungarian plane which as i say is the
last bit of of step uh in
in the area
but the the scythians or scythian
related peoples
spread right across the step to the
royal city
there uh north of the black sea the
pontic area
um and they all had different names
and what we're seeing there are the
names that the greeks knew them by
but they are all these uh warrior nomad
peoples and it they were not static it
was this constant movement the constant
flow of some breaking off and and going
great distances setting themselves up in
positions of power over the local
natives and then moving on again and
again and really like a lot of dominoes
falling the whole time um as these
movements continued
now
it's from the greeks that we get some
bits of history coming in we've got two
sources basically for scythians we've
got the archaeology the hard archaeology
and we've got um what the greeks tell us
about them we have no history of
scythians from the mouths of cythia
one of the groups
we know in detail about they settled
in the north caucasus this is
uh this is chechnya and oscetia that
sort of area now
southern russian federation still
uh and um they built their their tombs
and then they did what all good um
warrior horsemen do they raid they find
somewhere to raid aware better than in
asia minor where the assyrians
um were
being beaten up by the uratians there's
a a big war going on here so um from
their settlements they would go out uh
and take part in that war sometimes on
one side sometimes on the other side um
and the the some of these um journeys
may have taken a very short time
um you know over
when when the summer starts you think
it's a good time to go off raiding so
you go through the caucasus and have a
good time and get some
loot and so on and then go back um the
ones we know most about um are the ones
who are properly called scythians who
settled north of the black sea in the
the pontic step as the crimea
um
and uh most of that that's ukraine and
that's russia now
not quite sure where the border now is
but um
uh and uh there were various groups of
them and the different colors there
um just represent slightly different
cultural groups so
although we use the word scythian for
the whole lot there were different sorts
of scythians some of them were actually
growing grain
some were not and
they had slightly different um artistic
um motifs and so on but um that that's
just an archaeological nicety
essentially uh all those were scythians
um you see uh with his goritas there
with the bow in
and the arrows there spear the short
dagger by the side this one is wearing
iron scale armor
and armored helmet and he's carrying his
shield on his back she'll probably made
of of
timber
sticks
held together with leather

something very mysterious happened
in that part of the world
that historians have chosen to bury
[Music]
a tribe called
chose
to embrace judaism
and so the world witnessed for the first
time
the very strange
[Music]
phenomenon
of a
non-semitic people
becoming jews
non-semitic
becoming jews
and these people the khaza
chose to
convert to judaism
but they did so not
for any religious reasons
they were not so much
interested in the kitab
and to follow the law
they embrace judaism
for
purposes of political experiencing
there was sandwich between islam and
christianity byzantine christianity
and they chose judaism
then they came under pressure to take
sides in a growing contention around
them
coming down from the north was
eastern orthodox christianity and coming
up from the south was islam
and they knew that if they succumbed to
pressure from either of those to join
their organization and embrace their
philosophy
it would surely offend the other
and so what they did was a politically
expedient maneuver he called in all the
religious leaders of the area
and he
got their input and after
the input he's announced
for me
and my people we're talking about 20
million people about 4 000 nobility
for me and my people we choose to become
jews now this was not a heartfelt
conversion this was not something that
was
deep in their breasts that they felt
they needed to
uh make a conversion because they
thought that was the proper way to serve
the creator this was something that was
done as a political expediency
now these people
[Music]
have run into some trouble over time in
965 a.d they were overrun by the
vardanians which was
swedish swedish ruled slavic people
varganyan is the russian word for
vikings
and they were militarily defeated which
curbed their expansionist philosophy for
some time
and then in 1140 they were literally
overrun by the mongols for
kublai khan and genghis khan
and they were driven down into eastern
europe

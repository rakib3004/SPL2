so what exactly happened to jesus
there's no definitive uh answer to this
uh the substitution theory is certainly
something that is uh um
very popular um what's interesting is
that there was a group of early
christians called the basilidians and
this is mentioned by saint irenaeus
that they were quite active in
in north northern africa
and basilides
uh and clement actually says that
facilities learn from glaucia who
learned from peter so he sort of gives
this sort of
chain of transmission that goes back to
actually peter
but according to irenaeus
facilities was teaching
um in north africa a very early
christian teacher that that simon of
cyrene was transfigured to look like
jesus and vice versa
and simon was crucified so this type of
docetism this kind of literal dosetism
so what's interesting is that by the
time we get to the gospel of john
right john uh because he has the gift of
hindsight
he makes some really interesting
uh unique contributions when he's
writing his gospel so the synoptic
gospels say
that for no apparent reason the romans
just
pull a man out of the crowd and they
compel him to bear the cross
and of course in sort of
popular christian depictions and
iconography and movies and things like
that of the passion play it's because
jesus is so
you know he's he's so beaten and so uh
you know he's scourged down to his you
know bowels as joshua mcdowell used to
say and you know his muscles are falling
out he's just too weak to carry the
cross but the gospels don't actually say
that
in fact luke doesn't even mention that
jesus was scourged at all in luke no
roman actually lays a hand on jesus
which is quite interesting
but
but they say that the gospel the
synoptic gospels say that they just pull
this man out of the crowd simon of
cyrene to compel him to bear the cross
now john is probably riding around 90 95
100 even even after that probably
that's sort of the general consensus
and he completely eliminates this entire
uh
tradition of simon of cyrene that's
mentioned in three synoptic gospels
so scholars they see something that like
that and they wonder why did john do
that why make this sort of edit well
maybe
by the time john wrote his gospel this
belief was quite prevalent
that jesus was not crucified that
someone else was crucified that possibly
simon of cyrene was crucified so john
wants to set the record straight
right
and say no he he bore his own cross
to golgotha
and john does that quite often
so
in the gospel of mark
we're told that jesus you know he died
after six hours on the cross and pilate
marveled right he was surprised this man
this man is dead already and pontius
pilate the roman governor he made a
career out of crucifying jews
he knew how to crucify and he he you
know he he saw what had happened
apparently the jesus with the scourging
the beatings but he marveled at thal
muslim says the greek he was completely
surprised how can this man be dead
already
right
um so
um
so it so
in the gospel of john right
jesus is impaled on the cross
to let the reader know he didn't survive
this ordeal whatsoever because that
seems to be i mean one can sort of
maybe mark is mark himself as responding
to this sort of pre-marking tradition
that maybe jesus was put on the cross
but he didn't actually die so in other
words the swoon theory which is another
possibility from from a muslim
perspective that he sort of survived the
crucifixion
um because
they did not cause him to die on the
cross he might have been put on the
cross but they did not cause him to die
or he didn't die on the cross
another possibility that i would like to
entertain
is called divine rapture
so in the quran very interestingly
we are told that god says to jesus
right and we don't know the exact
context of a context of when jesus when
god actually said that to jesus peace be
upon him but in
so this is uh an active participle of
the fifth form of taweffa
which
is used in the quran a few times
something like 24 times the verb tawafa
and the primary definition of tawaffa
means to die
it literally means biological death
there are a couple times in the quran
where it means
um
to know in other words to die like the
guy of
the death of sleep like you're not
necessarily a total biological death but
to actually be um
uh be caused to sleep as it were yeah um
but most of the time when this verb is
used in the quran it signifies actual
death right uh imam ibn kefir in his
famous tafsir he does mention a few
early authorities
um who who interpret the the word like
that as well he says the meaning of this
is
like i will cause you to literally die
um
so this does not you know so so so the
possibility here the theory here of
divine rapture is that jesus was placed
on the cross
but before he
before he died from his injuries as it
were or before the cross killed him
before they killed him with the cross
god intervened directly in
and caused him to die
[Music]
and i will cause and i will raise you
unto myself
right
so one can make the argument here that
the quran does not say that jesus was
not crucified it simply says that they
in the context of the jews they did not
crucify him
that god could have directly intervened
and saved him and then possibly returned
his because jesus is
a spirit owned by god
right and god does what he wants with
his with his spirits
and with his servants it's possible that
two three days later whatever a few days
later that god returned his soul the
soul of jesus back to his body
resurrected him uh and then jesus showed
himself to his disciples
[Music]
and then they forced their hand of the
roman government to execute him but how
by hanging
crucifixion why did they want him die
like that
because it's still there in the torah
it is still there up to now
they've not taken it out they're not
going to take it out whoever dies by
hanging
is the curse of allah
so if we can get him to die like that
it will now become absolutely plain and
clear beyond the shadow of a doubt
he could not have been the messiah
[Music]
and then when they saw him die
they were so overjoyed they could dance
with joy
walk only him allah says they're
boasting now
[Music]
[Applause]
we've killed him
the messiah meaning sarcasm
the son of mary the messenger of allah
they didn't believe allah they thought
he was an impostor
when they saw him die on the cross
before their very eyes
it was now absolutely plain and clear
beyond the shadow of a doubt he could
not have been the messiah why
he has the curse of the lord upon him
why
he's dead but he never ruled the world
from jerusalem
with a rule which is eternal
[Music]
so they're now convinced beyond any
shadow of a doubt
he could not have been the promised
messiah so they're waiting for the
messiah to come
what they didn't know
and what no one knew
absolutely no one knew
not even the pope
until allah revealed the quran no one
knew it
was
no they did not kill him
that was their first objective to kill
him
so allah says you did not achieve
objective number one
[Music]
objective number two was to cause him to
die on the cross not on the ordinary
debt
so allah says no you did not achieve
objective number two as well because he
was not crucified
[Music]
well i can should be
allah made it appear unto you that that
was what happened
[Music]
but
they allah raised him unto himself
how
did allah make it appear
that he was crucified now kindly
listen
carefully
now this verse has been interpreted by
classical commentators on the quran
as meaning that someone else was
transformed made to look like jesus and
that someone else was
crucified instead of jesus so that
whereas everything appeared as though
jesus was being crucified
in fact it were not so
now i said classical his uh interpreters
of the quran and that may give the
impression that these are the original
and earliest interpreters but they were
not
in fact neil robinson a very able
scholar from leeds university in the
united kingdom in his book christ and
islam and
christianity
has traced the origins of these
interpretations and found them to be
originating from iraq in the
middle of the second century
some classical commentators on the other
hand struggle with the variety of
interpretive detail that was given by
various commentators and the best
summation of that i have found to be in
the tastil kabir the big tough fear the
big commentary by
the pride of the
faith of razki
now arazi after summarizing all of the
various interpretations that have been
offered by muslim scholars on this in
the end he concludes by saying these
interpretations are contradictory one to
another and in the end only god knows
what happens now it's worth to retrace
our steps and find out where all these
varied interpretations came from where
did muslim scholars get the idea that
someone else was made to look like jesus
and crucified instead
this came from a variety of sources
including informers
from people of other faiths in the area
there were
some early christian groups not the
earliest mind you from the second
century of christianity forward there
were gnostics who believed that someone
else was made to look like jesus in the
mel gibson movie we saw simon of cyrene
carrying the cross along with jesus and
some had believed that simon was in fact
transformed to look like jesus and was
crucified instead
of jesus and so this kind of information
fed into the muslim commentaries but now
when these commentaries are examined
carefully
most modern scholars will tend today in
islam to think that something else is
the reality behind the quranic narrative
yusuf ali for example in his translation
of the quran has it such
that
even though it appeared
to the onlookers that jesus had died on
the cross in fact he had not died
further to that
we have muhammad assad in the message of
the quran again the translation and
commentary on the quran well rooted in
the traditional tafsirs
saying also that the stories which grew
up within muslim tradition to say that
someone else was put on the cross
instead of jesus is not necessarily what
the quran implies and in fact he found
and he exposed a very a difficult
problem with that interpretation what he
said was
that
the passage
these stories that grew up among muslim
commentators ignored a grammatical
problem that was there in in the way
they have interpreted the verse and this
grammatical problem was pointed out
by an ancient classical uh scholar
of puranic tafsir a scholar by the name
of azamakshari in his tafsir known as
al-khashaf the unveiling and what
zamachary said was that
in fact when you look at the passage it
says he was made to appear
to them
but it could also mean it was made to
appear to them
because in the arabic reference the
reference who
uh using a personal pronoun there could
refer to him or to it
and he said that
if in fact this verse is referring to
the crucified person
that the crucified person was made to
look like jesus that crucified person
should have previously been mentioned so
that the referent could be attached to
him
so if you're telling the story and you
said he said we want to know who is this
he
but if this person was just mentioned a
little while ago we know this is
referring to that person if the person
was not mentioned you have to introduce
him by name and so some actually pointed
out that this could not be a reference
to the crucified individual
but the classical commentators who are
basing their commentary on the idea that
this referred to jesus
but them actually pointed out that in
fact it couldn't refer to jesus because
it was not jesus who was made to
resemble someone else according to their
explanation it was someone else who was
made to refer to jesus and so i'm
actually proposed instead even though he
himself did not reach the logical
conclusion of this proposal he proposed
that the verse actually means
it was made so to appear to them as in
the arabic expression
it seemed so to them
so now many modern commentators would
follow that interpretation and say
that what the verse is saying is that
even though it appeared to them that
they had crucified jesus in fact they
had not done so in the final summation
this verse of the quran does not
necessitate the belief that someone else
was put on the cross instead of jesus
but it leaves open the possibility that
jesus did not actually die on the cross
and this in a nutshell is the muslim
belief that even though the enemies
thought they had jesus thought they had
him killed they were not successful in
doing that
in his serial quran explains the word
crucifixion as meaning to kill a person
by means of crucifixion it's not just
the crucifixion itself but it's a method
of execution
so as a method of
execution that failed on that occasion
to me this is what the quran is saying
they killed him not and in case they
were thinking about wait wait we
crucified him duran only saying well you
didn't even do that did you because if
you look back at the record you will see
that there was some doubt
the jews had requested for the knees to
be broken and the bodies to be taken
down but then the knees were not broken
this explains why in matthew's gospel it
says that the jews
who wanted him dead it came back the
next day which was the day of the
sabbath
because the crucifixion occurred on the
friday they said and then the sabbath is
the saturday jews came back and they
went to pilate and they said well wait a
minute seal up the tomb
at lest they their disciples will come
steal his body away and then they will
proclaim that he resurrected from the
dead and then the second deception would
be greater than the first what did they
think was the first deception you see
they left the scene on friday thinking
that jesus would be dead they had
requested that the legs of the crucified
victims be broken but only the other two
victims had their legs broken and
jesus's legs were spared so what was the
purpose of breaking the legs one theory
is that by breaking the legs you hasten
death right so the jews left the scene
thinking that his legs would be broken
he'll be done for they heard later on
that his legs weren't broken and now
they're saying well wait a minute seal
up the tomb because
the next thing you know he'll come out
of the tomb alive and then they will say
that he resurrected from the dead right
so they themselves had some doubt this
is why the quran says
those who differ about him
are in doubt concerning the matter ma la
home behemoth they have no knowledge
concerning the matter
except that they follow some conjecture
they just supposed that he was dead but
he wasn't actually dead so it seems to
me that this is what the quran is saying
they thought they had him dead but they
didn't kill him for certain that's why
the verse ends by saying um
but they didn't kill him for certain
how
did allah make it appear
that he was crucified now kindly
listen
carefully
allah says
allah made it a pair
like that
to cause an innocent man
to assume the appearance of the messiah
and then to be crucified
that is nonsense it is rubbish
and it is an act of injustice and those
who hold this view will have to answer
to allah for it one day
well then what happened
what happened
does the quran not say
that it was sent to explain all things
[Music]
how did allah
make it appear
that nabi islam was crucified
when he was not
the answer is there in the quran
in surah ali imran the third surah of
the quran and again in surah al maidah
the fifth surah of the quran
this context in this context
means taking the soul
only an angel can take you so won't you
agree with me
only an angel
and allah instructs the angel
to take your soul
so
in this context
the implication is that allah took the
soul
of nabi islam
is it possible
that he took the soul
and returned it
is that possible
in sura
of the quran
allah says
takes the souls
at the time of mouth about his death
allah takes the souls
at the time of death
and those whose souls are not taken
while they are awake allah takes the
souls while you are asleep for um
he then keeps those souls for whom
mouth is written
death is ordained
[Music]
and for those for whom mouth is not yet
written
allah returns the souls we know from
this verse one form
one form namely sleep
in which allah does this he takes your
soul and he returns it
this
may not be the only one but this is one
that while you're asleep he takes your
souls
and if mouth is not written for you if
death is not yet ordained for you
he then returns the soul
for a specific period of time in which
case
you did not die
no
that's why you're here sitting in this
auditorium today
if allah had kept the soul you will not
be here you will be underneath the earth
so now it is clear
if allah
took the soul
this is the context
in which the word wafaat is used
in both
this is the context
that allah took the soul
if he took the sword and he did not
return it
then
islam died
he was crucified
but allah says no they did not succeed
and crucify him
they did not crucify him they did not
kill him
and so there's only one
possible explanation left
and that is that of after allah took the
soul
and they were now convinced that he was
dead
and they took down
the body
some muslims don't want to hear that
no because they have this fairytale
interpretation of the quran
that no no jesus nabi islam was never
put on the cross i don't know where they
got it from
maybe the theory of substitution or
somewhere else
or maybe in disneyland
they took the body down
because they were convinced he was dead
they prepared the body for burial which
is janazah
and then they put the body in a cave
they sealed the cave and there's a roman
god outside
then allah returned
the soul
the soul has been returned to the body
so when the soul is returned to the body
you'd wake up you stand up wounded i
mean why is this subject so difficult
for some people to understand
so he's now alive
he never died
but if they know he's alive they're
gonna come after him again
so then allah raised a body and soul
everything
allah raised in the way he raised
a nocturnal journey
raising in the sense
of taking him from this material
universe
into other worlds of space and time i
have no other english word to use than
the word race
and i'm allowed to use the word raise
because in the quran allah uses the same
word
the prophet jesus
is no longer in our world of space and
time
no longer in our material universe
he has now been transported into
another world of space and time or what
the quran refers to
there are seven of them
and in physics they're called parallel
universes every physicist knows about it
ask einstein he'll tell you
since he never experienced death
no never experienced mouth no
and since allah says in the quran
of sin there is
every soul must taste death
it follows that nabi islam must return
but they did not know that they thought
he was dead
and they know that when allah gives his
word he keeps his word
so they're still waiting for the messiah
for when he comes
will rule the world
from the holy land from jerusalem
with a rule which will be eternal
meaning the end of history
i lived in new york for 10 years
and during that time i interacted with
the rabbis and the jews
and i can confirm to you oh yes they are
waiting on the messiah
and they believe the messiah is around
the corner
one day is coming back
and the son of mary will now rule
the world
from jerusalem
with a rule which will be eternal
and the religion of abraham
the true religion of abraham
would rule the world
from the holy land
what prophet muhammad brought
allah's blessings be upon you
is the religion of abraham
and so that will be the end of history
tell that to francis fukuyama for me
tell that to francis fukuyama and samuel
huntington for me
this is the truth not what they have
[Music]
